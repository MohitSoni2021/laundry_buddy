# 🧺 Laundry Management System

## 📌 Project Overview  
The Laundry Management System aims to modernize traditional laundry services by replacing outdated manual tracking with a digital platform. Many college-based laundries still rely on handwritten records, leading to misplaced orders, tracking issues, and inefficiencies. This system provides a **user-friendly, online** solution for **users, workers, and admins** to manage orders, track laundry status, and optimize stock handling.

## ❓ Problem Statement  
Laundry services in colleges face **several challenges** due to their offline nature:

🚫 **No real-time updates**, leaving users uncertain about their order status.  
📊 **Stock mismanagement**, leading to delays.  
🕒 **Long wait times**, as all processes are handled manually.  

## 💡 Existing Solutions  
Current laundry services mainly rely on **phone calls, manual logs, or WhatsApp updates**, which:  

❌ Lack real-time tracking for users.  
❌ Are prone to human errors.  
❌ Do not provide automated workflow management.  

## ✅ Solution Overview  
A **fully online platform** that ensures:  

🛒 **Users** can submit orders, track laundry progress, and view order history.  
👕 **Workers** can process orders, update stock, and send notifications.
